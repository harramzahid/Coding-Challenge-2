// Coding Challenge: Bill Splitter Application

//Task 1 calculating the tip based on bill size
// array order of bills
let Bill = [X]
if (Bill = 50 <= X <= 300) { let tip = Bill*0.15;}
else if ( Bill = X > 300 ) { let tip = Bill*0.2; }
console.log("tip", tip);

// Task  2 Output Details
let totalbill = tip += Bill 
console.log("tip += Bill", totalbill);
console.log (`Thank you for your order, your bill was $$"Bill", the tip was $$"tip" and so, the total value is $$"totalbill" `);
